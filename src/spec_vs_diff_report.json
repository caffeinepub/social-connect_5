  "summary": "The implementation provides a comprehensive Instagram-like social media application with authentication, user profiles, follow system, stories, reels, and chat functionality. Most requirements are implemented, though there are notable gaps in the feed display logic and some backend API endpoints. The UI design meets the modern aesthetic requirements with proper navigation and layouts.",

      "requirement": "Chat history is preserved and retrievable",
      "reason": "The backend stores messages in a single Map keyed by message ID, but there's no clear conversation-based retrieval or indexing. The frontend useGetMessages hook is referenced but the backend getMessages implementation is truncated and unclear if it properly retrieves conversation history between two users.",
